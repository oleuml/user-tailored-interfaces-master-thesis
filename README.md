# Master Thesis

My master thesis is about the comparison of two UIs for privacy settings. In order to determine this, a study is conducted. In this study, a questionnaire is asked, which first asks general information about the user. This is followed by the IUIPC-10 scale. After the general information is determined, the users are shown 2 different UIs in random order. There they have to complete different tasks. After each UI, a usability questionnaire (SUS) is asked. During the execution, meta information is collected to track the behavior afterwards.
All questions and tasks are in German, since the study also takes place in German-speaking countries.

## Data protection and privacy

No IP addresses or other personal data are stored. The only information that is stored is the user agent to track whether the user completed the tasks from a smartphone.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
